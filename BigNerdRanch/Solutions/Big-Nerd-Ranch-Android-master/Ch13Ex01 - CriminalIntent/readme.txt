Ch13Ex01: Deleting Crimes

Once a crime has been created in CriminalIntent, there is no way to erase
that crime from the official record. For this challenge, add a new action item to
the CrimeFragment that allows the user to delete the current crime. Once the
user presses the new delete action item, be sure to pop the user back to the
previous activity with a call to the finish() method on the
CrimeFragment’s hosting activity.
