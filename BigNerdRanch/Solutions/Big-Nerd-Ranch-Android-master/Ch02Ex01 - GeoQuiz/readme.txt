Ch02Ex01: Add a Listener to the TextView

Your NEXT button is nice, but you could also make it so that a user could press
the TextView itself to see the next question. Hint: You can use the
View.OnClickListener listener for the TextView that you have used with the
Buttons, because TextView also inherits from View.
